# Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp (Completed)

This repository contains my completed projects and exercises from [The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=24T7MT260525G2) by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.

## 📁 Contents

This repository documents the sections and exercises I found most relevant to my learning journey.  
I have successfully completed the parts of the course that were valuable to me and skipped a few sections where I already had prior knowledge from university or professional experience.

### **⚠️ Note on Section 36 – React**

The React content in Section 36 does not come from Dr. Angela Yu's course, because I wanted to learn and use a newer version of React.  
Instead, I followed the course **[Modern React From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-from-the-beginning/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING)** by **Brad Traversy & Will Adams**.

All React-related projects are maintained in a separate repository:  
👉 [My React Projects Repository](https://github.com/Nils-Scharein/React-Course)

### 🔧 Code Structure

- **My own code** is typically located in the respective **`code.html`** files.
- Each `code.html` file corresponds to a specific exercise or lesson and contains the related HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
- Additional files like CSS stylesheets, images, or JavaScript files may be included depending on the task.
