# Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp

This is my personal project repository for [The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=24T7MT260525G2) by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.

## 📁 Contents

This repository accompanies me through the various chapters and exercises of the course. It includes both smaller practice files and more extensive projects.
I skipped some sections because I had already acquired the knowledge at university or through other experiences.

### **⚠️ Note on Section 36 – React**

The React content in Section 36 does not come from Dr. Angela Yu's course, because I wanted to use a newer version of React.
Instead, I am following the course **[Modern React From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-from-the-beginning/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING)** by **Brad Traversy & Will Adams**.

All React-related projects are maintained in a separate repository:

### 🔧 Code Structure

- **My own code** is typically located in the respective **`code.html`** files.
- Each `code.html` file corresponds to a specific exercise or lesson and contains the related HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
- Additional files like CSS stylesheets, images, or JavaScript files may be included depending on the task.
